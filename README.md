This is a tiny little JavaScript game that allows users to mimic playing with magnetic poetry on a refrigerator.
It was written as a final project for Harvard Extension School's Spring 2015 CSCI-E3 Course: "Introduction
to Web Programming with JavaScript," taught by Larry Bouthillier.

It demonstrates the use of JavaScript libraries (jQuery), API interaction and JSON, handling events,
use of closures, and creation/modification of DOM elements.
